Deep Learning tutorials
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Content

This package/repository is not a library, but a set of tutorials using
several libraries with models and utilities for computer vision using
deep learning.

These tutorials were built in a way that their contents are
self-contained, and that they can be used as a basis for other
experiments.

The tutorials will cover models and tools for semantic segmentation,
object detection, image classification, tracking, augmentation, model
evaluation, among other topics.

## Datasets

These tutorials are the fruit of different Lapix researchers, who
throughout their masters or doctoral degrees developed several computer
vision datasets.

Therefore, these tutorials were created from experiments using the
following datasets:

1.  [CCAgT: Images of Cervical Cells with AgNOR Stain
    Technique](https://doi.org/10.17632/wg4bpm33hj.2)
2.  [Clouds-1000](https://doi.org/10.17632/4pw8vfsnpx.2)
3.  [UFSC OCPap: Papanicolaou Stained Oral Cytology Dataset
    (v4)](https://doi.org/10.17632/dr7ydy9xbk.1)
